Initially licensed as ABTI University, it was established with guidance from American University in Washington, DC, and constructed on land donated by the Lamido of Adamawa. Renamed AUN in 2007, it began with a distinguished international Board of Trustees, including figures like Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu and former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. The university opened in 2005/2006 with 124 students and has since expanded to include Schools of Law and Engineering and School of Basic Medical and Applied Science, alongside its original schools (Arts & Sciences, Business & Entrepreneurship, and IT & Computing). It graduated its first class of 92 students in 2009 and has maintained steady growth. AUN is Nigeria’s first fully wireless university, offering 24/7 high-speed internet. It gained NUC accreditation in 2008 and introduced postgraduate programs, including an Executive Master’s in IT (2012), Ph.D. programs, and a hybrid MBA. The Robert A. Pastor Library and E-Learning Center, opened in 2014, houses an award-winning e-library. All AUN presidents have been American nationals, starting with Dr. David Huwiler, with Dr. DeWayne Frazier currently serving. The Board of Trustees has been chaired by notable figures, including Alhaji Ahmed Joda and currently Senator Ben Obi. AUN remains committed to US-style education with a focus on development issues."
